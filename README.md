# School District Analysis
Panda and Jupyter Notebooks

## Collecting the Data 

For this assignment, we were given a large file of information with reading and math scores for high school students within the public and charter school system.

Collecting the data was just a beginning, we started off by looking for empty values, duplicate information, and change data types to produce a more accurate outcome. As a result of that, we can now gather information quickly and more accurately. 

After gathering all the information, we were asked to display the average reading and math scores of students based off grade level, the school they attend, and the school type.  We provided a student body count per school and the student with the lowest reading school in the county. 

## Analysis 

Some analysis information worthwhile is locating the top performing students in math and/or reading and analyze which school has the best outcome. We can eventually use this information to narrow down which teacher may produce the most students with high scores. That will help the school district with finding and obtaining new teaching methods and best practices that can be shared with other educators to revamp their education system. 

Students scoring under 50% can also be analyzed by their teacher and not just their scores. It is evident that the students who meet or score below expectations should be given an opportunity for a different teaching method.
